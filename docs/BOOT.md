# Boot logs

I've captured various boot logs.

## Orange Pi Zero2 Poky boot

A good boot from a Poky build (no changes) targetting an Orange Pi Zero2.

## Orange Pi Zero3 Poky boot

This is the problem I started with when attempting to build poky for
Orange Pi Zero3:

```
U-Boot SPL 2023.07.02-g (Aug 28 2023 - 17:53:07 +0000)
DRAM:This DRAM setup is currently not supported.

resetting ...

```

## Orange Pi Zero3 boot with no SD card

The Orange Pi Zero2 comes with SPI flash and it contains a diagnosis image.

Just for curiosity here's the output. The UART is enabled and it transmits by
default at 115200 baud.

## Booting OrangePiOS

Booting from the OrangePiOS Opios-arch-aarch64-xfce-opizero3-23.07-linux6.1.31-4gb.img.xz
is stored in OrangePiZero3-orangepios.txt

## Booting from a build of OrangePiOS bookworm

Using https://github.com/orangepi-xulong/orangepi-build.git (commit 2dbd451) we
can build OrangePiOS on debian bookworm using 'next' 6.1 kernel and with a desktop
environment. I did this and the build output is recorded.

See OrangePiZero3-orangepios-build.txt

## Building Poky with downstream forks

If we modify the yocto build environment to use the xunlong forks, what happens?

* https://github.com/orangepi-xunlong/u-boot-orangepi.git origin/v2021.07-sunxi
* https://github.com/orangepi-xunlong/linux-orangepi.git origin/orange-pi-6.1-sun50iw9

I had to set I had to set `rootdev=mmcblk1p2` in boot.cmd to get it to boot,
but otherwise it works! This is probably an optimal boot to aim for. It's fast.

See OrangePiZero3-poky-them.txt

## Building Poky with downstream kernel

If I add back in the default poky u-boot but keeping the kernel fork, this is
what we get. It's slower but still works.

See OrangePiZero3-poky-their-kernel.txt

## Building Poky

If I add back the default poky linux-mainline (with some of my changes) then I
get this:

See OrangePiZero3-poky.txt

## Status

I'm feeling confident that u-boot is as good as it needs to be now.

Having added the dtb to linux-mainline 6.1.31, it boots but no devices work. It's a mess.

I read that with dtb inserted into linux-mainline 6.5.% it should work. Going to try.
- If it works, then u-boot must be fine.
- Can I stick with that version or do I need to go back to 6.1.31?
- I should have more confidence about going back if this works. IT DIDN'T.

Next, can I put my kernel into their image to see if I get x11? And vice versa?

* Get u-boot working faster.
* Get Linux booting into graphical.
* Why does the LED flash?
* Why is rootdev mmcblk1p2?
* Power management: u-boot/arch/arm/mach-sunxi/pmic_bus.c
* Sound
* Is GPIO there?
